    "# Use Case Description\n",
    "Automating the prioritization of critical alerts from a large volume of security alerts is essential because it enables security teams to focus on the most urgent and impactful threats quickly. Without automation, manually sorting through numerous alerts can lead to delays, missed critical incidents, and inefficient use of resources. Automation using LLMs improves response times, reduces alert fatigue, and ensures that critical vulnerabilities are addressed promptly, enhancing overall security posture and operational efficiency.\n",

       "   *Why Critical:* This alert indicates a severe issue where system services couldn't start due to disk quotas being reached. Such failures can lead to downtime, loss of critical data, or inability to perform backups, leading to significant business disruptions. Immediate attention is required to resolve this and prevent further issues like data loss or corruption.\n",

       "   *Why Critical:* A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on SSH could render the system inaccessible to legitimate users, disrupting operations and potentially leading to data breaches if attackers use it as a smokescreen. Continuous monitoring and swift action are needed to mitigate such attacks and ensure availability.\n",
