    "# Structured Outputs with Foundation AI Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The Foundation-Sec-1.1-8B-Instruct model can now produce structured outputs that adhere to complex [JSON schemas](https://json-schema.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides examples for generating structured outputs \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Integrating LLMs into production workflows often requires the model to respond in a strict pre-defined schema, or a structured output. LLMs can be constrained to adhere to a user-defined schema at both the training and inference stages. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Training**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Foundation-Sec-1.1-8B-Instruct model has been fine tuned on tasks that require structured outputs, including JSON schema generation and API completion. The additional fine tuning helps the model better understand complicated schemas and improves performance compared to earlier versions of the Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inference**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the LLM has been fine tuned to understand complex schemas, it is a probabilistic system and still prone to making mistakes in the structured response. To reduce mistakes, we recommend applying a technique called constrained decoding at inference time. Constrained decoding guides the output of language models by modifying the probability distribution produced by the model to only allow tokens that are valid for the desired schema. There are many popular, open-source libraries for constrained decoding, such as [Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) and [xGrammar](https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Setup: Deploying Foundation-Sec with a vLLM server\n",
    "\n",
    "One recommended way of wrapping a Foundation-Sec model in a constrained decoding wrapper is to use [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/v0.8.2/index.html), an open source library built for LLM inference. vLLM supports generating structured outputs using outlines, lm-format-enforcer, or xgrammar as backends for the guided decoding, and utilizes OpenAI's Completions and Chat API for passing the structured output format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples here assume an inference API endpoint has been set up with vLLM inference using OpenAI's API. For instuctions on how to deploy the model with vLLM to common inference platforms such as Sagemaker or Baseten, see \"deployment\" examples under \"adoptions\".\n",

    "1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This document outlines the architecture design for a cloud-hosted, multi-tenant photo storage application. The application will allow users to upload, store, and retrieve photos using a web-based UI and public-facing API. The solution is designed to be reliable, secure, scalable, and performant, while ensuring proper isolation for tenant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. System Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The system consists of three main layers:\n",
    "\t1.\tPresentation Layer: Web-based user interface (UI) and API for external integrations.\n",
    "\t2.\tApplication Layer: Backend logic for handling photo uploads, metadata management, and user authentication.\n",
    "\t3.\tData Layer: Storage for photos and associated metadata, including a relational database and an object storage system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The application is cloud-hosted and leverages managed services to ensure reliability, scalability, and cost-efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Architecture Design\n",
    "3-Tier Architecture Overview\n",
    "\t•\tTier 1: Presentation Layer\n",
    "\t\t•\tWeb-based user interface for users to upload, view, and manage photos.\n",
    "\t\t•\tPublic-facing REST API for external integrations (e.g., mobile apps or 3rd-party services).\n",
    "\t•\tTier 2: Application Layer\n",
    "\t\t•\tHandles business logic, user authentication, photo processing (e.g., compression, resizing), and API requests.\n",
    "\t\t•\tResponsible for routing requests to the appropriate services in the data layer.\n",
    "\t•\tTier 3: Data Layer\n",
    "\t\t•\tObject storage for photo files.\n",
    "\t\t•\tRelational database for user data, metadata, and application configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Components\n",
    "\t•\tNginx: Acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer. It routes user requests to backend services and serves static assets efficiently.\n",
    "\t•\tBackend Application: Implements API endpoints, business logic, and photo processing workflows.\n",
    "\t•\tRelational Database: Stores user accounts, metadata (e.g., photo details, tenant information), and application data.\n",
    "\t•\tObject Storage: Stores uploaded photos and provides scalable storage for large files.\n",
    "\t•\tMessage Queue: Handles asynchronous tasks such as photo processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture provides a robust foundation for the cloud-hosted photo storage application. By using Nginx as the reverse proxy and load balancer, the system ensures efficient request handling and routing. The design ensures multi-tenancy, reliability, scalability, and security while maintaining high performance. Using managed cloud services minimizes operational overhead and allows the application to scale seamlessly as user demand grows.\n",
